            <h1>Privacy policy, AlphaTrainer for Android</h1>

            We want to be clear about the kinds of information we collect, and how it is used.

            <strong>Android device permissions used</strong>

            This is a complete list of permissions requested by the latest version of the app. This list will be updated as the set of necessary permissions and the intents of their usage change.

            Full network access (android.permission.INTERNET)
            Purpose: Anonymous data collection. See details below.

            Bluetooth connections (android.permission.BLUETOOTH)
            Purpose: For connectiong to external brain-computer interface.

            Access to external storage (android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
            Purpose: Storing/caching raw EEG.

            Vibration (Bluetooth connections (android.permission.VIBRATE)

            <strong>Data Collection</strong>

            AlphaTrainer for Android collects anonymous data in order to better understand the needs and behaviours of its users. This information helps the app's developers to identify areas of improvement. Specifically, the data collection includes aggregated EEG data (e.g. alpha levels) and meta-data (e.g. selected feedback interface) from training sessions. Over time such data will inform about, for example, the relative effectiveness of different feedback interfaces.

            The data collected is anonymous in the following sense: An unique user id is generated and stored on the users phone. This id is sent along with the data but never associated with any user information. It is only used to associate data origining from the same device. The data collection is transferred over the internet securely via HTTPS.


            <strong>Changes</strong>

            AlphaTrainer for Android is under development, so changes to this policy are to be expected.

            Changes to this policy will be announced in the app changelog in a timely manner.
